*What perfect number is:
A perfect number is a positive integer that equals the sum of its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself). 
For example, 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors (1, 2, and 3) sum to 6. 
Similarly, 28 is also a perfect number (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28).
