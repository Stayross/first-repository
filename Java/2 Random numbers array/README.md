A) Initially, you are asked to declare and initialize a one-dimensional array of 10 integers with random numbers selected from the interval 
1,100.

B) Then, display the elements of the array on the screen.

C) Find the pair of 2 integers that are located in consecutive (adjacent) positions in the array and have the smallest difference (in absolute value) among all other pairs.

D) Finally, print the integers that are at those positions in the array.

For example, if we have the following array of 10 positions with the following random numbers from 1 to 100:

28 4 30 27 50 64 52 91 5 86

Then, the numbers that are in consecutive positions in the array and have the smallest difference are 30 and 27.
