Question A
In this task, you are asked to implement a Java program that:

Takes two strings as input from the console.

Then, implements a method to check whether one string is an anagram of the other.

An anagram is defined as a word or phrase that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.

You must:

Ignore spaces between words.

Consider uppercase and lowercase letters as the same.

Question B
Implement a method that:

Accepts two strings as input.

Prints all common substrings (at least 2 characters long) that exist in both strings.

Note: The comparison must be case-insensitive (i.e., ignore differences between uppercase and lowercase letters).



*Compile and run with two strings as entry.
