The purpose of Newton's method is to find a root of a function. 
The idea is to start with an initial guess at a root, approximate the function by its tangent line near the guess, 
and then take the root of the linear approximation as a next guess at the function's root.

Program at Fortran find root of a predefined function ( you can change the function and the first derivative manual on programm)
User gives 
1 first approach (x0)
2 TOL>0 (if |xn+1-xn|<TOL then xn+1 is the result)
3 NMAX (max number of iterations)
