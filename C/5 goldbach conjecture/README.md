Goldbach's Conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in number theory. 
It states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. 
For example, 4 = 2 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 8 = 3 + 5, and so on. 
Despite extensive testing and verification for extremely large even numbers, a formal proof of this conjecture remains elusive. 

program takes two numbers n and m from user. 
Check them if they are integers.
Print all evens from n to m as sum of first numbers. 
Additional prints The average number of prime pairs that equal an even integer between n and m.
