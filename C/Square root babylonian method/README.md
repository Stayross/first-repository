Find square root of a number using Babylonian method

*Babylonian method:
Make an initial guess. Guess any positive number x0.
Improve the guess. Apply the formula x1 = (x0 + S / x0) / 2. The number x1 is a better approximation to sqrt(S).
Iterate until convergence. Apply the formula xn+1 = (xn + S / xn) / 2 until the process converges. 
Convergence is achieved when the digits of xn+1 and xn agree to as many decimal places as you desire.
